# papier

Simple Static Site Generator (Paper in Dutch)

## Goals

* Simple to use like Pelican and Jekyll.
* But do not need to learn a new syntax.
* Fully support only GitHub's Markdown and Python's ReStructure Text.

## TODO:

* [ ] Native support for `docutils`. See https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/lib/github/commands/rest2html.
